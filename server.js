/**
 * - This app is optimized so it is production ready
 * - This app will be executed or run through this file
 * - Compression in Node.js and Express decreases the downloadable amount of data thatâ€™s served to users. 
 *   Through the use of this compression, we can improve the performance of our Node.js applications as our payload size
 *   is reduced drastically. Source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-compression
 * 
 * - Code flow: 
 *  - Import/require compression package to minimize the size of prduction build
 *  - Invoke express app through app variable
 *  - Apply compression as middleware
 *  - Serve the static build of the app in the "build" folder when we run "npm run build" command
